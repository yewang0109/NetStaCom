Code for the paper Networked dynamic systems with higher-order interactions: stability versus complexity

The function of each file is depicted at the beginning of each file

All codes are written by MathWorks Matlab R2022b

To run the code, make sure that all files are in the same folder

This code is an example to show the stability of set structured systems. To investigate other parameters which could affect the stability of set structured systems, you only need to change the values of the parameters accordingly.
